# Neural Nets *from scratch*

Implementing basic neural network examples from scratch to get experience about 
lower-then-usually seen level of neural nets.

Keras & Tensorflow made me lazy - I do this to redeem myself.

# What is done

- two class classifier softmax, which is _very_ flat neural network
- two class classifier neural net
- 4 class classiยง

## Next steps

There is quite a bit of interesting work that can be done!!

- make nice writeups about this stuff (maybe ipython notebooks ?)
- show interesting scenario in the one layer multiclass, where RELUs saturate
  and we have to wait until they jump onto higher prob
- considering the above point, compare with ELUs
- refactor layers into classes ? Can be very interesting
- implement MNIST and convnets
